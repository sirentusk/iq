    <h1>Admission</h1>

    <p>Only one test score needs to be above the threshold on either of the Cattell tests to gain entry into the Mensa Institute.</p>
    
    <p>I was 1 point off acceptance with a score of 131 as the top 97.3% rather than 97.5%. As admission rounds up to the 98% threshold.</p>
    
    <p>So a score of 132 for a .16 standard deviation (SD) is the cutoff for entry of 97.72% which is a roundup from 97.5% to 98% within the scores of the total human population.</p>
    
    <p>IQ tests generally take multiple times to gain a perfect representative score. Depending on the test will be how many times you need to do it.</p>

    <p>This variance is called a <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/confidence-interval/" target="_blank">confidence interval</a>, standard error of measurement or reliability score.</p>

    <p>Reliability studies of the Cattell Culture Fair IQ test indicate that it hovers around .75 to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-018-1098-4" target="_blank">0.92</a>.</p>

    <p>I only did the test once. So if I took the test again, it is extremely likely I would gain at least 1 IQ point and be admitted into Mensa. It's on my bucket list of things to do.</p>

    <p>Retaking the test in Australia is very expensive with a psychologist. This <a href="https://www.benchmarkpsychology.com.au/services/adult-assessments/" target="_blank">website</a> quotes between "$1500 and $2100" AUD, this <a href="https://lifepsych.com.au/services/iq-testing/" target="_blank">website</a> $990, as common examples. As the psych needs specialised training.</p>
    
    <p>Mensa in Australia only runs tests infrequently compared to the UK and doesn't offer the Cattell as an option. There are a handful of main IQ tests (WAIS, Stanford, etc).</p>
        
    <p>Mensa USA offers both the Cattell and it's own test. Mensa UK offers the Cattell (CFIT-III) as the standard main test.</p>

    <p>So I decided that it's just better to combine the test with a holiday when the time arrives.</p>
    
    <p>So I will resit the test at some point when I go back to the UK where its only £25 to do the test, or the US which is $60-$100.</p>
